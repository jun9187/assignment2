## Reflection
After this event, I learnt more details about all the great services we use daily in UTM such as UTMWifi, UTM Smart. The UTMDigital staffs' hardword on providing and improving the services for us should be appreciated, so we should use those services wisely.
Besides that, the industrial visit exposed us to the real ICT working environment help us gain some insight about working environment of ICT field.
